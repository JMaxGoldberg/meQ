**The Trigger:** Your 6-year-old sees the clock and starts panicking: "We're going to be late! I don't like being late!" Your 9-year-old, still organizing, says defensively: "I'm doing something important! Give me five more minutes!" You realize you also haven't had coffee and have a 9 AM work meeting.

**The Trigger:** Your 9-year-old emerges from their room: "I forgot I need to finish this project! It's due tomorrow and I'll get in trouble!" Your 6-year-old hears this and gets worried: "Are we not doing our normal bedtime? Will you still read to me?"

**Your Internal Response:** The project might be real, but this also feels like bedtime avoidance. Your anxious child needs predictability, but you also don't want the ADHD child to genuinely get in trouble at school.
